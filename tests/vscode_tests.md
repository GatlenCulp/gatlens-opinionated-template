# VSCode Manual Testing

At some point this may be automatic. See [here](https://github.com/GatlenCulp/gatlens-opinionated-template/pull/4) for details.

1. Test each task (the [Task Explorer Extension](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=spmeesseman.vscode-taskexplorer) is really helpful for that)
1. After instantiating, open each code-workspace file
1. Check `.cursorrules` is rendered properly, ask Cursor a question about the project.
1. You can check Makefile commands by hand as well.
