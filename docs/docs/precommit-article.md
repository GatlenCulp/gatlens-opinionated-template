# Effortless Code Quality: The Ultimate Pre-Commit Hooks Guide for 2025

## Background

I've been tinkering with app development since middle school, but it wasn't until the latter half of my undergrad that I got my first taste of professional software engineering which was a whirlwind of new concepts‚ÄîCI/CD, unit testing, packaging, dependency management, linting, formatting, schemas, databases, remote machines, cloud infrastructure, Git branches beyond `main`, etc.

This flood of information, combined with my growing obsession with systems design (and mounting frustration with outdated tools and sloppy code), sparked a deep dive into modern development practices. I channeled this energy into creating [GOTem](https://gatlenculp.github.io/gatlens-opinionated-template/) (Gatlen's Opinionated Template), a project template that weaves together what I consider the best practices and most robust tooling available. It's a bit overkill, but building GOTem served two purposes: helping me learn these tools through hands-on experience, and creating a foundation for future work that embodies the practices I was discovering. It's a relaxing side project alongside my normal responsibilities that I hope will bring a unique perspective to the AI Safety research space‚Äîat least until these skills are automated away. (‚úñÔπè‚úñ)

During this journey, I fell in love with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks ‚Äî simplicity, power, and a wonderful "set-it-and-forget-it" quality. Unlike heavier solutions like [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), pre-commit hooks integrate seamlessly into daily development while remaining lightweight. They're particularly valuable for research teams who need quality assurance but don't want to wrestle with complex CI/CD setups‚Äîyou can make them as strict or lenient as your workflow demands.

What follows is my carefully curated collection of pre-commit hooks, primarily (but not exclusively) focused on Python development. While my original documentation includes detailed explanations of alternatives and other information, Medium's format limitations mean I've had to summarize this content. For the complete rationale behind these choices, check out [GOTem's Pre-Commit documentation](https://gatlenculp.github.io/gatlens-opinionated-template/precommit/).

This page explains what pre-commit hooks are, why they are used, and the specific selection I have decided to make for GOTem to keep your projects pristine with every commit. The source config file can be found [here](https://github.com/GatlenCulp/gatlens-opinionated-template/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## What are Git hooks?

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are scripts that run automatically at some stage in the git-lifecycle. Most commonly, pre-commit hooks are used, running before a commit goes through. They act as a first line of defense for code quality by:

- Catching formatting issues
- Finding potential security risks
- Validating configurations
- Running quick tests
- Enforcing team standards

## Why use pre-commit?

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework that makes these Git hooks:

1. **Easy to share** - Hooks are defined in a single YAML file
1. **Language-agnostic** - Works with Python, JavaScript, and more
1. **Fast** - Only runs on staged files and are much quicker than CI/CD
1. **Forgettable** - Team members don't need to memorize QA tools; hooks run automatically
1. **Extendable** - Large ecosystem of ready-to-use hooks

Pre-commit helps maintain code quality without slowing down development. While CI/CD pipelines might take minutes to run, pre-commit hooks provide instant feedback right when you commit. Despite the name, Pre-commit can install hooks at any stage (ex: Use a pre-push hook as a slightly more time-intensive pre-commit and push multiple commits at once.)

**Common Use Cases**

Pre-commit can be as strict as you want depending on your project's quality-time tradeoff. Here are cases where commit-level checks make more sense than pull-request level:

1. Linting/formatting code and data files
1. Re-building code or documentation
1. Making database migrations
1. Preventing secrets or large files from being committed
1. Requiring commit messages to follow a standard (Like [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/))
1. Running fast tests

> **Note**: Husky is a NodeJS-focused alternative to pre-commit, but has less multi-language support.

## Installation

Projects generated with GOTem come with the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file already configured as described below. If you would like to create your own, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pre-commit.com/#2-add-a-pre-commit-configuration).

Install the hooks with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

You'll see hooks run automatically on every commit:
![Pre-commit Example](./pre-commit_example.png)

**Useful Commands:**

```bash
# Test hooks without committing
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit without running hooks
git commit --no-verify
```

> **Note**: Use caution with `pre-commit autoupdate` on untrusted hooks due to potential security risks.

## Hooks

This collection prioritizes best-in-class tools without redundancy. Rather than using multiple overlapping tools, we've selected the most effective option for each task. For example:

- Python linting uses only Ruff instead of multiple separate linters
- JSON/YAML/TOML validation uses specialized schema validators
- Security scanning uses a single comprehensive tool

All hooks labeled with `# STRICT` are commented out by default and not recommended for every project. (Ex: Code style linters are typically desired for production-grade software but not research.)

## 01 üîí Security

**[GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)** is a fast, lightweight scanner that prevents secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens) from being committed to your repository.

> **Note**: TruffleHog is a more comprehensive but complex alternative to GitLeaks.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
  rev: v8.22.1
  hooks:
    - id: gitleaks
      name: "üîí security ¬∑ Detect hardcoded secrets"
```

## 02 üîç Code Quality

This section covers tools for code formatting, linting, type checking, and schema validation across different languages and file types. Best-in-class tools were chosen, avoiding redundant functionality. I opted for remote hook downloads over local commands to make the file more portable and self-updating.

### üêç python

**[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)** is a fast, comprehensive Python formatter and linter that replaces multiple traditional tools (Black, Flake8, isort, pyupgrade, bandit, pydoclint, mccabe complexity, and more.) While it's not yet at 100% parity with all these tools, its speed and broad coverage make it an excellent choice as the only Python linter/formatter:

- [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
- While Ruff does many things, type checking it does not... [yet](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3893).

> **Note**: Before Ruff, projects used multiple tools like Black, isort, Flake8, etc. Ruff consolidates these with better speed and modern defaults.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  rev: v0.9.1
  hooks:
    - id: ruff-format
      name: "üêç python ¬∑ Format with Ruff"
    # STRICT
    - id: ruff
      args: [ --fix ]
```

<br/>

**[Microsoft's Pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/)** handles Python type checking:

- [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright), but [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), the default extension for Python, has it built-in.
- _This is a community supported pre-commit hook, endorsed by microsoft_

> **Note**: MyPy is the original type checker, but Pyright offers better speed and features.

```yaml
# STRICT
- repo: https://github.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python
  rev: v1.1.391
  hooks:
    - id: pyright
      name: "üêç python ¬∑ Check types"
```

<br/>

**[validate-pyproject](https://validate-pyproject.readthedocs.io/)** specifically handles pyproject.toml validation. In the future, I may have check-jsonschema do this as well.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject
  rev: v0.23
  hooks:
    - id: validate-pyproject
      name: "üêç python ¬∑ Validate pyproject.toml"
      additional_dependencies: ["validate-pyproject-schema-store[all]"]
```

### üü® JavaScript & Web Tools

**[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/internals/language-support/)** is a modern, fast formatter and linter for JS/TS ecosystems (JS[X], TS[X], JSON[C], CSS, GraphQL). It provides better defaults than ESLint.

- [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)

> **Note**: ESLint/Prettier are more established but slower; use them if you need specific plugins or framework support.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/biomejs/pre-commit
  rev: "v0.6.1"
  hooks:
    - id: biome-check
      name: "üü® javascript ¬∑ Lint, format, and safe fixes with Biome"
      additional_dependencies: ["@biomejs/biome@1.9.4"]
```

### ‚úÖ Data & Config Validation

**[check-jsonschema](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/)** validates various configuration files using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification). It supports JSON, YAML, and TOML files, and includes specialized validators like the [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) checker.

- Additional JSON schema available on [Schema Store](https://json.schemastore.org/pyproject.json)
- VSCode [automatically provides intellisense and validation for JSON files with schema](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_intellisense-and-validation)
- [GitHub Actions VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) provides action YAML file intellisense and validation.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema
  rev: 0.31.0
  hooks:
    - id: check-github-workflows
      name: "üêô github-actions ¬∑ Validate gh workflow files"
      args: ["--verbose"]
    - id: check-taskfile
      name: "‚úÖ taskfile ¬∑ Validate Task configuration"
```

### üìù Markdown

**[mdformat](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/)** for Markdown formatting with additional plugins for GitHub-Flavored Markdown, Ruff-style code formatting, and frontmatter support:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat
  rev: 0.7.21
  hooks:
    - id: mdformat
      name: "üìù markdown ¬∑ Format markdown"
      additional_dependencies:
        - mdformat-gfm          # GitHub-Flavored Markdown support
        - mdformat-ruff         # Python code formatting
        - mdformat-frontmatter  # YAML frontmatter support
        - ruff                  # Required for mdformat-ruff
```

**[Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/tree/main)** for Markdown linting.

- [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint
    rev: v0.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: markdownlint
        name: "üìù markdown ¬∑ Lint markdown"
```

### üêö Shell

**[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)** lints your shell scripts.

- [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)

```yaml
# STRICT
- repo: https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py
  rev: v0.10.0.1
  hooks:
    - id: shellcheck
      name: "üêö shell ¬∑ Lint shell scripts"
```

**[bashate](https://github.com/openstack/bashate)** checks your shell script code style.

```yaml
# STRICT
- repo: https://github.com/openstack/bashate
  rev: 2.1.1
  hooks:
    - id: bashate
      name: "üêö shell ¬∑ Check shell script code style"
```

### üêÆ Makefile

**[Checkmake](https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake)** for linting your Makefile.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake.git
  rev: 0.2.2
  hooks:
    - id: checkmake
      name: "üêÆ Makefile ¬∑ Lint Makefile"
```

### üìä SQL Code

**[SQLFluff](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/production/pre_commit.html)** can be used to lint and attempt to auto-fix any of your `*.sql` files automatically.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff
  rev: 3.3.0
  hooks:
    - id: sqlfluff-fix
      name: "üìä SQL ¬∑ Attempts to fix rule violations."
    # STRICT
    - id: sqlfluff-lint
      name: "üìä SQL ¬∑ Lint SQL code files"
```

### üìì Notebooks

**[nbQA](https://nbqa.readthedocs.io/)** for Jupyter notebook quality assurance, allowing us to use our standard Python tools on notebooks.

> **Note**: Ruff has [native Jupyter Notebook support](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#jupyter-notebook-discovery), making some nbQA features redundant.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA
  rev: 1.9.1
  hooks:
    - id: nbqa
      entry: nbqa mdformat
      name: "üìì notebook ¬∑ Format markdown cells"
      args: ["--nbqa-md"]
      types: [jupyter]
      additional_dependencies:
        - mdformat
        - mdformat-gfm
        - mdformat-ruff
        - mdformat-frontmatter
        - ruff
    # STRICT
    # TODO: Convert to pyright
    - id: nbqa-mypy
      name: "üìì notebook ¬∑ Type-check cells"
```

### üñºÔ∏è Image Optimization

**[oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)** is a PNG optimizer written in Rust with lossy and lossless options. (The selection of arguments below are slightly lossy):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng
  rev: v9.1.3
  hooks:
    - id: oxipng
      name: "üñºÔ∏è images ¬∑ Optimize PNG files"
      args: [
        "-o", "4",
        "--strip", "safe",
        "--alpha"
      ]
```

### ‚ú® Additional File Types

**[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (HTML, YAML, CSS)** handles formatting for various file types not covered by other tools. While it can be slow, sometimes produces code-breaking formatting, and I personally dislike it - it remains the standard for these file types.

- [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

> **Note**: Future plans include replacing Prettier with more focused tools for specific file types.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
  rev: v4.0.0-alpha.8
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      name: "‚ú® misc-files ¬∑ Format misc web files"
      types_or: [yaml, html, scss]
      additional_dependencies:
        - prettier@3.4.2
```

## 03 üìÅ Filesystem

**[Pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)** are collection of hooks managed by the pre-commit team. These hooks help maintain repository hygiene by preventing common file-related issues:

- `check-case-conflict` - Prevents issues on case-insensitive filesystems (Windows/MacOS)
- `check-symlinks` & `destroyed-symlinks` - Maintains symlink integrity
- `check-executables-have-shebangs` - Ensures scripts are properly configured
- `check-illegal-windows-names` - Check for files that cannot be created on Windows.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: v5.0.0
  hooks:
    - id: check-executables-have-shebangs
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/‚öôÔ∏è exec ¬∑ Verify shebang presence"
    - id: check-shebang-scripts-are-executable
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/‚öôÔ∏è exec ¬∑ Verify script permissions"
    - id: check-case-conflict
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/üìù names ¬∑ Check case sensitivity"
    - id: check-illegal-windows-names
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/üìù names ¬∑ Validate Windows filenames"
    - id: check-symlinks
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/üîó symlink ¬∑ Check symlink validity"
    - id: destroyed-symlinks
      name: "üìÅ filesystem/üîó symlink ¬∑ Detect broken symlinks"
    # ... More Below ...
```

## 04 üå≥ Git Quality

### ü™µ Repo Constraints

**[Pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)** again, this time for branch protection restricting unwanted actions.

- `forbid-new-submodules` - Prevent addition of new git submodules (repo-in-a-repo). (Imo, Git submodules are a perfectly find practice, but
- `check-merge-conflict` - Prevents committing unresolved merge conflicts
- `no-commit-to-branch` - Protects main branches from direct commits (GitHub branch protections are for enterprise members only (sad))
- `check-added-large-files` - Prevents committing files larger than 5000KB ([Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com/) or [Data Version Control (DVC)](https://dvc.org/) should instead be used)

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: v5.0.0
  hooks:
    # ... More Above ...
    - id: check-merge-conflict
      name: "üå≥ git ¬∑ Detect conflict markers"
    - id: forbid-new-submodules
      name: "üå≥ git ¬∑ Prevent submodule creation"
    - id: no-commit-to-branch
      name: "üå≥ git ¬∑ Protect main branches"
      args: ["--branch", "main", "--branch", "master"]
    - id: check-added-large-files
      name: "üå≥ git ¬∑ Block large file commits"
      args: ['--maxkb=5000']
      
```

### üóíÔ∏è Commit Message Standards

**[Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)** enforces high-quality standardized commit messages that enable automatic changelog generation and semantic versioning

> **Note**: Commitizen provides a CLI interface for standardized commits, with alternatives like czg for AI-generated commits.

```yaml
default_install_hook_types:
  - pre-commit
  - commit-msg
repos:
# ... other hooks ...
  - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
    rev: v4.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: commitizen
        name: "üå≥ git ¬∑ Validate commit message"
        stages: [commit-msg]
        additional_dependencies: [cz-conventional-gitmoji]
```

## 05 üß™ Fast Tests (Local)

While extensive tests may be too time consuming for a pre-commit hook, it can be helpful to run fast local tests to detect unexpected failures in your code before you are 10 commits in and unsure which one broke your code.

The example below uses `pytest`. The first hook checks that the tests don't contain any syntax errors and can be successfully collected. This should always pass.

The second hook runs all fast pytests using my custom pytest option which leverages the pytest-timeout feature you can read about [here](https://gatlenculp.github.io/gatlens-opinionated-template/pytest-customization/)

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: pytest-collect
      name: üß™ test ¬∑ Validate test formatting
      entry: ./.venv/bin/pytest tests
      language: system
      types: [python]
      args: ["--collect-only"]
      pass_filenames: false
    # STRICT
    - id: pytest-fast
      name: üß™ test ¬∑ Run fast tests
      entry: ./.venv/bin/pytest tests
      language: system
      types: [python]
      args: ["--max-timeout=3"]
      pass_filenames: false
```

<!-- Also maybe add profiling? -->

## Conclusion

This is by no means an exhaustive list of great hooks. Your encouraged to pick-and-choose as desired. Hooks don't exist for all tools, so if you want to run those you can always use a local hook:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: make-lint
      name: Run 'make lint'
      entry: make
      args: ["lint"]
      language: system
```

**final `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file**

```yaml
exclude: |
  (?x)^(
      .*\{\{.*\}\}.*|     # Exclude any files with cookiecutter variables
      docs/site/.*|       # Exclude mkdocs compiled files
      \.history/.*|       # Exclude history files
      .*cache.*/.*|       # Exclude cache directories
      .*venv.*/.*|        # Exclude virtual environment directories

### Other hooks to consider

Here are some other hooks I haven't added but would consider adding!

**Individual Hooks**

- [buildbuf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) - Protobuf Linter
- [Clang](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format) - C++ linter
- [gitlint](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint) - Alternative to commitlint, may actually be preferred.
- [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) or [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) - Finds common misspellings in code and documentation. One blog post preferred Typos over codespell because it found more typos (and apparently has VSCode support?)
- [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - YAML linter
- [yamlfmt](https://github.com/google/yamlfmt) - YAML formatter by Google
- [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) - Lints github action files, may be a better checker than the currently selected one.
- [uv pre-commits](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit) - A collection of pre-commits for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) by Astral
- [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) or [Deadcode](https://github.com/albertas/deadcode) - Detect unused code in Python
- [sync-pre-commit-deps](https://github.com/mxr/sync-pre-commit-deps) - Sync pre-commit hook dependencies based on other installed hooks (to avoid installing multiple versions I assume).

<br/>

**Hook lists**

- [featured hooks](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) by the pre-commit team
- [first-party hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks) by the pre-commit team (some used in this guide).
- [Megalinter's Supported Linters](https://megalinter.io/latest/supported-linters/) - Not all of these may provide pre-commits but regardless it's a great collection of QA tools!
- (More but you'll have to find them yourself :P)

<br/>

**What's Missing?**

- File optimizers for more than just PNGs (JPG, GIF, etc.)
- Profanity checker (You'll be surprised with the amount of profanity on repos you're about to make public). This can [possibly be done with GitLeaks](https://blog.nashtechglobal.com/profanity-check-source-code-with-gitleaks-why-not/)
- ... This list could go on and on ...

**Ensemble Hooks (Linters, Formatters, etc.)**

I went a bit overboard with cherry picking my favorite formatters, linters, etc. This may lead to maintaining more hooks than is worthwhile. It's on my todo list to look at ensemble linters and formatters such as [Megalinter](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main) and [Superlinter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter) which would GREATLY reduce the amount of overhead for code QA and provide support to languages without hunting down mutliple hooks for each of them. These also have the added benefit of better integration to other CI/CD tools, pre-built container images, and security scanning.

> ü¶ô MegaLinter analyzes 50 languages, 22 formats, 21 tooling formats, excessive copy-pastes, spelling mistakes and security issues in your repository sources with a GitHub Action, other CI tools or locally.

I'm slightly concerned that these ensemble linters might be an additional annoying piece of software to learn and configure that sets off small teams from using them entirely. Additionally, this software may not support your favorite linters - some of which mentioned in this guide include Biomejs and mdformat. I'm sure the list of available tools is extendable although I'm unsure how much effort is needed to do so.
