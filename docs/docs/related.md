Project structure and reproducibility is talked about more in the R research community. Here are some projects and blog posts if you're working in R that may help you out.

- [Project Template](https://projecttemplate.net/index.html) - An R data analysis template
- "[Designing projects](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)" on Nice R Code
- "[My research workflow](https://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html)" on Carlboettiger.info
- "[A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)" in PLOS Computational Biology

Finally, a huge thanks to the [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) project ([github](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)), which is helping us all spend less time thinking about and writing boilerplate and more time getting things done.

## Inspirations & Acknowledgments 🙏

This project builds upon the excellent work of several established templates and projects, in some cases borrowing and adapting individual files:

**[cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science)** 📊

- The original inspiration for this template
- Established many best practices for data science project organization
- Created by DrivenData, widely adopted in the data science community

**[cookiecutter-modern-datascience](https://github.com/crmne/cookiecutter-modern-datascience)** 🔬

**[cookiecutter-uv](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv)** ⚡

**[full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template)** 🚀

> 💡 While this template draws inspiration from these excellent projects, it takes an opinionated approach to combining their best aspects while introducing modern tooling and development practices.
