## 01 IDE

**[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)** üñ•Ô∏è
- Primary IDE with full ecosystem support
- Cursor fork provides enhanced AI integration
- Includes pre-configured workspace settings and debug profiles
- Supports remote development and notebook integration
- Replaces traditional Jupyter environments

> While many IDEs exist, VS Code's hackability, extensive ecosystem, and remote capabilities make it ideal for modern development. Cursor extends this with AI features while maintaining full VS Code compatibility. The decision to use VS Code even for notebooks (over JupyterLab) allows for a consistent development experience with all settings and extensions available.


<!-- TODO: Explain why not conda environment -->


## 02 Task Running

**[Task](https://taskfile.dev/)** üéØ
- Modern alternative to Make/Poetry scripts
- Simple, cross-platform task runner
- Excellent GitHub Actions integration
- Clean, intuitive YAML syntax

> Task was chosen over alternatives like Make, Poetry scripts, or Poe the Poet for its simplicity and cross-platform support. Its YAML syntax is immediately understandable, and it works seamlessly on Windows - a common pain point with Makefiles.


## 03 VCS

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/) + [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.com/) + [GitHub](https://github.com/)** üìö
- Industry standard version control
- Extensive ecosystem and integrations
- Built-in project management features
- Git Large File Storage (LFS) is a little-setup solution for file larger than the typical script like JSON files or Python Notebooks. Even larger files are recommended to use another storage solution such as a database or ignoring.

## 04 CI/CD

**[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** üîÑ
- Integrated CI/CD solution
- Simple configuration and maintenance
- Native GitHub integration
- Extensive marketplace of actions

> While there are many CI/CD solutions available, GitHub Actions provides the tightest integration with our repository platform. Its marketplace of pre-built actions and simple YAML configuration makes it ideal for small teams who need professional CI/CD without dedicated DevOps resources.

## 05 Containerization

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) + [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)** üê≥
- Standard containerization platform
- Orbstack for MacOS (lighter Docker Desktop alternative)
- VM support through Orbstack
- Consistent development environments

> Docker remains the standard for containerization, but Docker Desktop can be resource-intensive. Orbstack provides a lightweight alternative for MacOS users while maintaining full Docker compatibility and adding convenient VM capabilities. Kubernetes is being explored but may not be the best setup for small development.

**[Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/)** üì¶
- Standardized development environments
- VS Code integration
- *Note: Under evaluation*

> While Dev Containers show promise for standardizing development environments, they're included as an optional feature pending further evaluation by Gatlen.

## 06 Cloud Services

**[AWS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aws-vs-google-cloud-platform-vs-azure/#)** ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Mature cloud infrastructure platform
- Comprehensive service ecosystem
- Industry standard tooling
- Template remains cloud-agnostic where possible

> AWS was selected for its maturity and comprehensive service offering. However, recognizing that cloud preferences vary, the template maintains cloud-agnostic patterns where possible, allowing for easy adaptation to other providers.

> üí° These tool selections reflect a balance between modern capabilities, developer experience, and professional requirements. Each choice prioritizes simplicity and maintainability while ensuring scalability for growing projects.

## 07 Python Dependencies

**[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** ‚ö°
- Ultra-fast Rust-based Python package manager
- Combines functionality of Poetry, virtualenv, and pipx (with dirt easy deployment to PyPi.)
- Created by Astral (Ruff team)
- Significant performance benefits for CI/CD
- Maintains pip compatibility

> UV represents the next generation of Python package management. While tools like Poetry are mature, UV's Rust foundation provides exceptional speed (especially important in CI/CD) while maintaining compatibility with traditional pip workflows. Being from the Astral team (creators of Ruff) gives confidence in its long-term maintenance.
