# Guidelines for Writing Math Definitions

1. Structure:

   - Use column-aligned hierarchical definitions with names.
   - Align symbols/variables vertically for easy reference.
   - Utilize LaTeX align environment for precise alignment.

2. Notation:

   - Prefer interval notation over inequalities where appropriate.
   - Always state the bounds of variables and sets.

3. LaTeX Usage:

   - Use $\defeq$ for definitions instead of $=$.
   - Use $\defin$ for defining an element of a set instead of $\in$
   - Employ `\phantom{}` for proper alignment in complex equations.
   - Use the more semantic latex commands as they exist instead of formatting commands. Ex: `\Reals` instead of `\mathbb{R}` for the set of all real numbers $\Reals$.

4. Content Organization:

   - Start with the main definition.
   - Follow with detailed explanations of each component.
   - Include domain and codomain information for functions.

5. Clarity and Completeness:

   - Define all symbols and notations used.
   - Specify the type of each variable or set (e.g., "V := Vertex set").
   - Include quantifiers ($\forall$, $\exists$) when necessary.

6. Example Format:

$$
\begin{aligned}
G &\colonequals (V, E, w, h) &&
    G \colonequals \text{fin. undir. } \textbf{G}\text{raph} &&
    \mathbb{G} = \set{\text{all } G} \\
  &\phantom{=(V, E, w,} h\phantom{)} &&
    h \colonequals \text{node features} &&
    h_v \defin \mathbb{R}^m \land h_v \defin [-C, C] &&
    \forall v \defin V \\
  &\phantom{=(V, E,} w\phantom{, h)} &&
    w \colonequals \text{edge }\textbf{w}\text{eights} &&
    w_e \defin \mathbb{R} \land w_e \defin [-C, C] &&
    \forall e \defin E \\
  &\phantom{=(V,} E\phantom{, w, h)} &&
    E \colonequals \textbf{E}\text{dge set} &&
    E \subset V \times V \\
  &\phantom{=(}V\phantom{, E, w, h)} &&
    V \colonequals \textbf{V}\text{ertex set}\\
  &\phantom{=(V, E, w, h)} &&
    \phantom{w \colonequals \text{edge }\textbf{w}\text{eights}}&&
    \phantom{w_e \defin \mathbb{R} \land w_e \defin [-}C \defin (0, \infty)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

7. Additional Considerations:

   - For complex definitions, consider breaking them into multiple aligned equations.
   - Use descriptive variable names when possible.
   - Include relevant constraints or conditions.

8. Define Mapping of functions $f : x \mapsto y$ (This is instead of saying $f(x) := y$, I haven't fully made up my mind over whether this is much better)

# Comprehensive Guidelines for LLMs Solving Math Problems

## 1. Markdown and KaTeX Usage

- Write answers in markdown using $$\KaTeX$$ (a subset of LaTeX) math blocks.
- Always use double dollar signs ($$) for both inline and block math expressions.

## 2. Equation Formatting

- Use the `alignat` environment for multi-line equations.
- Number each step in manipulations.
- Align equations over the equality/inequality symbol.
- Place the main symbol as the leftmost element, even if it requires a new line mid-equation.
- Do not use `alignedat`; we want the numbering.

Example:

$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
    y - 2 &= 2 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial v} &&+ 5 \\
          &= 2 \cdot x                            &&+ 5 \tag{Given} \\
          &= 12                                   &&+ 5 \tag{x is 6} \\
    y - 2 &= 17                                        \tag{addition} \\
    y     &= 19
\end{alignat}
$$

## 3. Code Readability

- Make the source code as readable as possible.
- Use indented nesting for complex functions.
- Employ spacing within lines to enhance readability.

## 4. Macro Usage

- Utilize macros to improve source code readability and ease of writing.
- Use the modern syntax: `\newcommand\macroname[numargs]{definition}`
- Redefine macros in each math block as they are not saved between blocks in KaTeX.

Example:

$$
\newcommand\blue[1]{\textcolor{blue}{#1}}
\newcommand\x{\blue{x}}
\newcommand\y{\textbf{y}}
\newcommand\dd[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}}
\y = 2 \cdot \dd{u}{v} + 7 = 2 \cdot \x + 7
$$

## 5. Problem Restatement

- Always begin by restating the problem in a summarized form.

## 6. Styling and Colors

- Use colors for variables, terms, etc., as needed.
- Implement all styling through macros to maintain clean LaTeX.

## 7. Predefined Macros

- Use predefined macros over raw symbols when available (e.g., `\set{...}` instead of `\{ ... \}`).

## 8. Proof Structure

- Clearly outline the steps of the proof or solution.
- Use numbered steps for complex proofs.
- Provide brief explanations for each step.

Example:
**Prove that the sum of two even integers is even.**

_Proof:_

1. Let $a$ and $b$ be even integers.
2. By definition, $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers.
3. Consider the sum $a + b$:

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   a + b &= 2m + 2n \\
         &= 2(m + n) \tag{1}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

4. Since $m + n$ is an integer, $(1) \implies$ $2(m + n)$ is even by definition.
5. Therefore, the sum of two even integers is even. $\qed$

## 9. Mathematical Reasoning

- Explain the logical flow between steps.
- Highlight key insights or techniques used in the solution.

## 10. Conclusion

- Clearly state the conclusion of the proof or solution.
- Use `\boxed{}` to emphasize the final answer when appropriate.

## 11. Variable and Function Definitions

See @math_definitions.md

## 12. Assumptions and Given Information

- Clearly state any assumptions made or given information used in the solution.

## 13. Edge Cases and Constraints

- Address any edge cases or constraints relevant to the problem.

## 14. Alternative Approaches

- If applicable, briefly mention alternative solution methods.

Example:

$$
\newcommand{\integ}{\int}
\text{Calculate } \integ_0^{\pi/2} \sin x \, dx
$$

$$
\text{Approach 1: Direct Integration}
$$

$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
\integ_0^{\pi/2} \sin x \, dx &= [-\cos x]_0^{\pi/2} = 1 \tag{1}
\end{alignat}
$$

$$
\text{Approach 2: Geometric Interpretation} \\
\text{...}
$$

Remember to apply these guidelines flexibly based on the specific requirements of each problem. The goal is to produce clear, well-structured, and mathematically rigorous solutions.

## 15. Good Example

1. Weak domination condition:
   For $T$ to weakly dominate $B$, we must have:

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   u_1(T, L) &\geq u_1(B, L) \tag{1} \\
   u_1(T, R) &\geq u_1(B, R) \tag{2}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

   With at least one of these inequalities being strict.

2. Best response condition:
   Let $p \in (0,1)$ be the probability that player 2 plays $L$. For $B$ to be a best response:

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   \E[u_1(B, s_2)] &\geq \E[u_1(T, s_2)] \\
   p \cdot u_1(B, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(B, R)
   &\geq p \cdot u_1(T, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(T, R) \tag{3}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

3. From (1) and (2), we can derive:

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   p \cdot u_1(T, L) &\geq p \cdot u_1(B, L) \tag{4} \\
   (1-p) \cdot u_1(T, R) &\geq (1-p) \cdot u_1(B, R) \tag{5}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

4. Adding (4) and (5):

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   p \cdot u_1(T, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(T, R)
   &\geq p \cdot u_1(B, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(B, R) \tag{6}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

5. Note that (6) contradicts (3). Moreover, since at least one of the inequalities in (1) or (2) is strict, and $p \in (0,1)$, the inequality in (6) must be strict:

   $$
   \begin{alignat}{2}
   p \cdot u_1(T, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(T, R)
   &> p \cdot u_1(B, L) + (1-p) \cdot u_1(B, R) \tag{7}
   \end{alignat}
   $$

6. This strict inequality (7) directly contradicts the best response condition (3).

Therefore, it's impossible for $T$ to weakly dominate $B$ while simultaneously having $B$ as a best response to a belief that puts strictly positive probability on each of player 2's strategies.
