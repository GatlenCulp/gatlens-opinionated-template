# Contributing

This is a very small project. If you have large Pull Requests to make, I recommend making them over with the upstream at [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS)](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science). If you have recommendations/changes/particular issues with my implementation, feel free to leave an issue but I'm not sure if I will be able to get around to it.


> ## Contributing to CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS)
> The Cookiecutter Data Science project is opinionated, but not afraid to be wrong. Best practices change, tools evolve, and lessons are learned. **The goal of this project is to make it easier to start, structure, and share an analysis.** [Pull requests](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science/pulls) and [filing issues](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science/issues) is encouraged. We'd love to hear what works for you, and what doesn't.
