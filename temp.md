# Temp

Currently testing MegaLinter and Trunk Code Quality

## MegaLinter

- `.mega-linter.yml`
- `.jscpd.json`
- `cspell.json`
- `.github/workflows-old`

I really liked the setup process for MegaLinter. Doesn't have a lot of integration with VSCode though and the docs are maybe a bit funky. Trying out Trunk Code Quality, has an extension for VSCode.

## Trunk Code Quality

Okay, this has great VSCode integration.

Free plan is for up to 5 PRIVATE repo committers. Includes the basic features. Their cloud stuff becomes very limited (mainly analytics.)

Actually it does seem free for local use. They don't have any hard limits. Yada yada. I think I'll try this out for a bit.

Interface and docs are also pretty awesome. Has its own pre-commit interface. This all seems fine. Blah.

I like that you can share the config easily among projects. I don't know why they git ignore it though. I do like everything being stored in `.trunk` and the whole LSP thing.

It has a nice CLI that asks you which changes to make. It ranks how bad some uses are. Mwah. Unified interface for all linters.
